**Refract** is an emotionally adaptive money app that listens to how you feel. Rather than tracking just numbers, Refract intuitively responds to your emotional patterns‚Äîbending its interface and feedback to reflect who you are and who you're becoming.

Forked from the open-source app **Cashew**, Refract introduces a reflective, ambient, and introspective take on personal finance. It quietly reframes your financial decisions in the context of your evolving emotional world.
